                    focuses on grapping with particular emphasis on 
                    ground fighting. BJJ adovcates the concept that a smaller
                    weaker person can successfully defend themselves against 
                    a bigger, stronger,heavier opponent by using techinque leverage 
                    and most noteably taking the fight to the ground. This is a very 
                    nice sport that everyone should pratice so they can defend 
                    themselves whenever they are under attack. Some jiu jitsu clubs
